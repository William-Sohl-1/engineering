        test we have alos found all the eauations we nened to use so we can fully experiment with our car and make sure our desighns will be effetive for our 
        desiered goal of going farther than any and all other mousetrap cars i would alos like to somehow beat one arduino car

<p>we made a 30 in locng car with intermedite holes in it to reduce weight and to make the car go further we alos made a 17in long rod whcih was used to make our
car go its overall length whcih is give or take the whole cafeteria or 55ft our first des was used to make sure all math and our ideas were correct which thankfully
worked well enough the biggest differnece was size rod length and axel material which gave us our almost double length of our first one if i were to make a third one
i would starighten the wheels and add more string to make it go farther

<p>we are maing and working on secreing an egg drop where we can safely drop an egg form a two stry building using a variety of materical indluing but not limted to
paper cardboard and of course tape we have foud out their are two ways to secure our egg to eithe rmake the drop safer or our egg safer we have done both we are 
allowd to bring a box from home whihc our pryamid will drop into where sticks will catch it this should keep our egg safe as it is also surrond by cotton balls which
will cushion its fall from the building teh weakest part would be the grabing sticks brekaing mid flight or the ballos popping whcih will be stopped using
