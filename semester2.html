        <p>1/26/24- this week we began the car construction project where we began to make either an arduino car or a mousetrap car i began to make a mousetrap car 
        with my nw parnter reza or som as people call him so far its going good we have a few good ideas we will do our bom and finsish our experimenal design and 
        test we have alos found all the eauations we nened to use so we can fully experiment with our car and make sure our desighns will be effetive for our 
        desiered goal of going farther than any and all other mousetrap cars i would alos like to somehow beat one arduino car
            
        </p>

<p>well we spent most of our time working to make our first draft of our car so we can check our math and make sure everything works and will make sense so our cars
second itearation will work better than evryone elses th goal for this week is to complete car one and begin car two to try and perfect our desighn and be cewl i 
played lethal company and died alot and had a good time also played dugreed and finsihed the parkour puzzle so yeah

<p>we made a 30 in locng car with intermedite holes in it to reduce weight and to make the car go further we alos made a 17in long rod whcih was used to make our
car go its overall length whcih is give or take the whole cafeteria or 55ft our first cars test was used to make sure all math and our ideas were correct which thankfully
worked well enough the biggest differnece was size rod length and axel material which gave us our almost double length of our first one if i were to make a third one
i would starighten the wheels and add more string to make it go farther and make sure to luanch it corrctly

<p>we are maing and working on secreing an egg drop where we can safely drop an egg form a two stry building using a variety of materical indluing but not limted to
paper cardboard and of course tape we have foud out their are two ways to secure our egg to eithe rmake the drop safer or our egg safer we have done both we are 
allowd to bring a box from home whihc our pryamid will drop into where sticks will catch it this should keep our egg safe as it is also surrond by cotton balls which
will cushion its fall from the building teh weakest part would be the grabing sticks brekaing mid flight or the ballos popping whcih will be stopped using

 <p>we tried to use a few stargeys ut in the end i belived we overenginnered full style over substance we also missed our catching contration which did really affect
 how well our egg did overall unlike our desighn the starws had oved so the egg landed cold and hard on the pavment causing the egg to shatter apart which lead to it
 breaking and leaking all over the place like well an egg over the spring break im going to play teh super duper fun game called palworld where i will enslave and force
 little beings to work and produce moeny guns and ammo for me to go and kill and capture more little aniamls ill also play torchlight im trying to get to max level and
 im ony 85 ut i did figure out an easy way yo farm

    its going well so far we expect our boat to go aroud 50% of the overall legth we hope to research more and go maybe 60-70% but there is only a small chance we will
    manage to go the full length but in an ideal world we would its a medium sized boat with a sail the funnest part of my break was plannign out dnd and playing grounded 
    wtth my pooki ethan i hope to maintain my A

<p>we had ot make a small boatwithe teh singualr and specif goal of trabeling 500 cm to the end of a thin gutter which was filled with 5-6cm of water and with medium to low windspeeds
which heavily effected teh resuls of everyones boat we went around 40cm it didnt do as well as we expected or hoped it woudl thanks to how stiff teh sail was which made it much more
diffuclult to blow and travel across thanks to our manul bretahing method the best idea would have bene to make teh sail of a less firm material and make it more suspictable to being
blown i also would have liked to better inslute it so water would not have gotten in as easily i liked the bussiness presentaion i had a lot of fun and got a good grade and i think i
had a very informative and impresisve presneation and i didnt enjoy the LED breadboard project im going diablo 4 and im going to read my new book called finnegans wake its very goofy
and i like it

<p>were making a pretty big bot whcih should be able to hold two epople of differing heghts an dweights and it shoud be able to go their and go back im very worried about it as im one of
the two people this weird cardboad things has to hold and ot drop in teh water and kill overall not that bad but still ive got reasosn to worry my fit migt get wet ad soaked an dthat would
fucking suck but oh well ill lock in and wont worry too much ill just try and help and work with my team to do my best and make sure i ask my teachers and peers for teheir overall opions
and thoughts regarding issues and the thinsg atht they may involve but we also had a chalenge which my team didnt get last in as we made  avery veyr very finickey bridge but overall it was fun 
but thansk to thsi eyar being almost over i get to be exicted baout playig skyblock and playing he numbe rone game of diablo 4 which im so close to being max level in but i think i have around
10 more levels to go so as long as  i do some more whisper caches and trees plus if i get lucky with advanced cases and such but i would need more emebers which their is a low chnace i can
finish teh battle pass in the time left but y never know

<p>through all of our work we have done quite a bit we made multiple peices and used a good amount of cardboard we have fully mesaured out the pontoons and the bottom of the ship which should 
complete the bottom and sides minus of course our walls which should be tall enoug im a bit worried about the whoe that will be iside of it but im sure our smart bois will figue it all out for us 
overall were doing well we could be doing much worse so im quite happy with our progress ive mainly been mesaureing stuff and telling them to mkae stright lines overall i ahve been useful to my 
group my only concern is that we will run out of tape time or all of the above but overall the worst thing that can happen is that we sink and oh well we wil have had fun atleast im very excited 
to actualy see this whole boat coe together into one consice thing without us just saying it will work so im overall very very excited about actually getting this whole thing done and over with
most of the white sterotypes are good i gues sthe ony one that isnt true os taht people assume im racist which is wrong

<p>this week we did really good like super duper superman in metropilis good we gooned even we did very well of course the best thing we did ws finish two of the mfro poontoons for the boat one
of the things we also got done was make the ponntoon supports so all of this week is gonna be spent to make the perfect main pontoon so this week will get all the walls for the boat done i hope atleast
im concerned that our partner somo will raise the bar yet again on us and will make teh mian pontoon even bigger which would make my life and job so so so so so much more work for me
