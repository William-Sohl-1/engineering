    9/8/23 - This will be  my third journal entry i would say i had a good week the major part was playing flag football
    which i had fun playing and rembering how i used to play this week i learned how troublesome and annoying tinkercad can
    be but also how helpful and benifical it can be for making plans and cading porjects and other assinments
    our machine will use a ramp to bring our ball to a cup then pulley it down and have it go on a platfrom for it to then
    trigger a set of reactions to use a seesaw the correct name escapes me then to knock down some domonos then for it
    to knock a ball into a funnel whch will then go down onto a sort of cannon contraptcion whcih will use the air to fire
    off a needle to then finally opo a ballon the most challengeing part will of course be to make this air cannon contraption
